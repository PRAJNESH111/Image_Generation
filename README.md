# Image_Generation

A flexible, extendable repository for image generation experiments and demos — prompt-driven generation, model inference, quick demos, and templates for training or fine-tuning. This README is a living template: update sections marked with TODO to describe the exact implementation, dependencies, and scripts in this repository.

## Project overview

Image_Generation is a starter codebase for experimenting with image generation. It collects scripts, notebooks, and (optional) small web UIs for running pre-trained generative models, experimenting with prompts, and iterating on model training or fine-tuning. The repository is intentionally modular so you can swap models, backends, or UI frameworks with minimal changes.

Use this repo to:
- Run inference with an image-generation model (local or remote).
- Iterate on prompt engineering and sampling parameters.
- Prototype a minimal web UI or API for demoing the model.
- (Optional) Train or fine-tune models on custom datasets.

Replace the TODO sections with your repo-specific details (scripts, model names, environment variables).

---

## Features

- Prompt-driven image generation scripts (inference)
- Example Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration
- Config-driven model and runtime settings (.env / config files)
- Utility scripts for dataset inspection and preprocessing
- Optional Streamlit/Flask demo to showcase generated images
- Template for training/fine-tuning workflows

---

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/PRAJNESH111/Image_Generation.git
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add credentials or model weights as described in [Configuration](#configuration).
4. Run a quick generation:
   python scripts/generate.py --prompt "A photorealistic astronaut riding a horse" --output outputs/

Note: If the repository does not contain `requirements.txt` or `scripts/generate.py`, adapt the commands to your project layout or add those files.

---

## Installation

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- pip
- Optional: CUDA-enabled GPU + matching CUDA/cuDNN for PyTorch/TensorFlow

Install:
1. Clone:
   git clone https://github.com/PRAJNESH111/Image_Generation.git
   cd Image_Generation
2. Setup venv:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If you use Conda:
   conda create -n img-gen python=3.9
   conda activate img-gen
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If no requirements file exists yet, create one with the packages your code uses (e.g., torch, torchvision, transformers, diffusers, pillow, streamlit).

---

## Configuration

- .env or config.yaml
  - MODEL_NAME: name or path of the model checkpoint to use
  - HF_TOKEN (optional): Hugging Face API token for downloading models
  - CUDA: whether to use GPU

Example .env (create at project root):
```
MODEL_NAME=runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
HF_TOKEN=hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
DEVICE=cuda
```

Adjust config file names and keys to match the repository code.

## Usage

Replace script names and parameters with actual files in this repo.

CLI
- Generate a single image:
  python scripts/generate.py --prompt "a cozy cabin at sunset" --output outputs/ --seed 42 --steps 25 --width 512 --height 512
- Batch generation from prompts file:
  python scripts/batch_generate.py --prompts prompts.txt --out outputs/batch/

Notebook
- Open and run the demo notebook:
  jupyter notebook notebooks/demo.ipynb
  or
  jupyter lab

Web UI (optional)
- Streamlit demo:
  streamlit run web/streamlit_app.py
- Flask demo:
  export FLASK_APP=web/app.py
  flask run

## Examples and tips

- Prompt engineering: be explicit with style, lighting, camera, and composition. E.g.: "ultra-detailed 35mm portrait, soft rim light, cinematic color grading"
- Seeds: set seeds for reproducible outputs.
- Sampling parameters: number of diffusion steps, guidance scale, and scheduler choice often change trade-offs between fidelity and diversity.
- Output postprocessing: apply simple color correction, upscaling (ESRGAN), or denoising for production-ready images.

---

## Training / Fine-tuning (optional)

If you plan to fine-tune:
- Provide dataset in a standard structure (images/ and annotations/ if applicable).
- Use a training script template: scripts/train.py
- Hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, checkpointing frequency
- Save checkpoints to models/checkpoints/

Warning: Training generative models can be compute-intensive. Prefer fine-tuning lightweight adapters or LoRA methods if you have limited resources.

---

## Evaluation

- Qualitative: visual inspection, side-by-side comparisons
- Quantitative (optional): FID, IS, or CLIP-based similarity metrics
- Save evaluation logs and generated samples to outputs/ for reproducibility
